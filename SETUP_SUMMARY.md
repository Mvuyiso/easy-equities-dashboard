# EasyEquities Dashboard - Setup Summary

## Project Overview

The EasyEquities Dashboard is a web application that provides a modern interface for tracking and visualizing your EasyEquities investments. The application consists of two main components:

1. **Backend**: A Django REST API that interfaces with the EasyEquities client library
2. **Frontend**: A React application with Material UI for a responsive and user-friendly interface

```

## Setup Process

1. Created the project directory structure
2. Copied backend files from the existing Django project
3. Copied frontend files from the existing React project
4. Updated the Django settings to point to the new frontend build directory
5. Created a comprehensive README.md with setup instructions and API documentation

## Configuration

### Backend Configuration

The backend is configured to:
- Use the EasyEquities client library to interact with the EasyEquities API
- Provide REST API endpoints for account information, holdings, transactions, etc.
- Serve the React frontend in production

### Frontend Configuration

The frontend is configured to:
- Use Material UI for a modern and responsive design
- Connect to the backend API endpoints
- Provide visualizations for portfolio data
- Support multiple accounts and different views (dashboard, holdings, transactions, etc.)

## Running the Application

### Backend

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e ../..  # Install the EasyEquities client library
python manage.py runserver
```

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

## Next Steps

1. Test the application with your EasyEquities credentials
2. Customize the frontend as needed
3. Deploy the application to a production environment
